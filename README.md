# MyLab
This is a project I work with three others during ICHACK event at Imperial College London. The theme of this hackathon is about wearable devices. We have choosen Google Glasses as our gear to develop our idea. 

The app empowers students to have a better learning experience in labotories for showing experiment instructions on Google Glasses so that they have both hands free to focus on the experiment itself.
